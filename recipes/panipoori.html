    <p>Pani Puri, also known as Golgappa or Phuchka, is a popular Indian street food that consists of crispy, hollow puris (bread) filled with a flavorful mixture of spiced potatoes, onions, chickpeas, and tamarind water.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <li>Sooji (Semolina)</li>
        <li>Atta (Whole Wheat flour)</li>

        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Mix dry ingredients: Combine 1 cup fine sooji (semolina), 2 tablespoons atta (whole wheat flour), and a pinch of salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add water: Gradually add ¼ cup hot water to the mixture and knead until a stiff dough forms. Knead for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest the dough: Cover the dough with a wet cloth and let it rest for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Knead again: Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes once it’s rested.</li>
        <li>Portion the dough: Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll out one part into a thin rope.</li>
        <li>Cut and shape: Cut the rope into small pieces (about the size of a blueberry) and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten each ball slightly into a disk shape.</li>
        <li>Roll out into circles: Use a rolling pin to roll out each disk into a circle, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.</li>
